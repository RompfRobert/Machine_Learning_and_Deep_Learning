        "As with all major systems in technology (like browsers) there is a constant state of \"platform wars\", where the different solutions and ecosystems vie for dominance. This is also the case with deep learning frameworks.\n",

        "During it's course of development, Tensorflow amassed a seizable community, just by the virtue of being a large scale, deployable system with a giant as Google backing it. None the less, developing TF 1.x based code was absolutely not a smooth experience. \n",
        "\n",
        "The concept of execution Sessions and \"define-and-run\" made debugging clumsy and complicated, the programming solutions used were unlike other \"standard\" systems, and the whole thing was just somehow \"un-pythonic\".\n",
        "\n",
        "This also paved the way for the emergence of new competitors, most notably [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) backed by Facebook Research (and very much inspired by Chainer). It is a full \"pythonic\" framework, with native conditional statements, command flow control, iteration, etc. It is a great tool for experimental code for new architectures, thus it became hugely popular in the research community. It was originally not an industry grade deployable framework, but it is being enhanced in that direction. \n",
        "\n",
        "None the less the popularity of Pytorch amongst the research community proved to be a major challenge for Tensorflow. In fact, in 2019 [this](https://thegradient.pub/state-of-ml-frameworks-2019-pytorch-dominates-research-tensorflow-dominates-industry/) article argued, that Pytorch is winning the game, since it has the backing of the research community.

        "[Tensorflow @function decorator](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function) is another nice facility. Even if we omit it, we can - as we saw above - write Pythonic code that gets executed eagerly, so we can build up complex structures in a functional manner. None the less, if we would like to make the code __run more efficiently__, we can use  the decorator, that results in TF trying to __compile our ops to a static graph, thus speeding it up__."
